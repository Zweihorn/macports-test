# A MacPorts Test Repository
## Information
Please refer to the [macports-test project Wiki](https://github.com/Zweihorn/macports-test/wiki) for further information.

## Introduction
The **MacPorts Project** is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the Mac operating system. There are many ways to get involved with MacPorts and peer users, system administrators & developers alike.

Please be aware you should use the [port lint](https://guide.macports.org/#using.port.lint) command if you modified a Portfile before submitting patches back to MacPorts. The lint action checks if the Portfile conforms to the [MacPorts development standards](https://guide.macports.org/#development).

The **macports-test project** is an open-source effort to develop *Portfile* definitions and patch files to simplify the task of compiling and installing open-source software on your Mac. The macports-test project is a user initiative and is neither an official part of the MacPorts project nor a direct part of the open-source software projects referenced. 

Downloading and testing any experimental port definitions and/or experimental ports from macports-test onto your own Mac should be done deliberately at your own risk. Before you start this you may find the information of both the [MacPorts Guide section 4.6. Local Portfile Repositories](https://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories) and the [MacPorts Guide section 2.2.4. Install Multiple MacPorts Copies](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.source.multiple) quite helpful for such experiments. 

## Issues
The macports-test project page provides a [Github issue tracking page](https://github.com/Zweihorn/macports-test/issues). Please be aware that I am not the developer of the open-source software projects referenced by my experimental ports and this project is just a user initiative.
