# macports-test
Testing some ideas on existing ports or newly invented ports for the MacPorts project.

The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the Mac operating system. Apparently there are many ways one can get involved with MacPorts and peer users, system administrators & developers alike.
